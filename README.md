## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
iris = load_iris()
 
X = iris.data # Features
 
y = iris.target # Labels

```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for experienced data scientists, engineers, and developers proficient in Python, statistics, and ML lifecycle looking to transition to databricks from DIY clouds. Introductory Spark knowledge is a must to make the most out of this book, however, end-to-end ML workflows will be covered.
